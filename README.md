# Covid Data Analysis with SQL

This SQL project analyzes data related to Covid-19 cases and vaccinations. 

It retrieves data from two tables: coviddeaths and covidvaccinations.

The data is filtered to eliminate anomalies, and important statistics are calculated, such as the probability of dying from Covid in a particular location, the percentage of the population that has been infected, and the percentage of the population that has received at least one Covid vaccine. Additionally, the project identifies the countries and continents with the highest infection and death rates. 

Overall, this project provides insights into the spread and impact of Covid-19 across different locations.
